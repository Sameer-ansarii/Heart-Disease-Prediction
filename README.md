# Heart-Disease-Prediction

This project is aimed at predicting whether the person has heart disease or not using supervised and unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithms like K-Mean Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest. The dataset used for this project was a dummy dataset and it contains various features such as BP, Age and Cholesterol.

# Content
This dataset contains records of patients.
Heart disease is the target variable to predict. It means -- patient has heart disease Yes or No?

# Data Description
1) Age - Age of Patient.
2) Sex - 0 = Male, 1 = Female.
3) BP - BP of the patient.
4) Cholestrol - Cholestrol of the patient.
5) Heart Disease - 0 = The patient is not having Heart Disease and 1 = Patient is having heart disease

# The targets of the analysis are:
1) To analyze the dataset content using EDA and to understand if it's possible build one model allowing to predict heart diseaes in the patients or not.
2) To train a model allowing to predict heart disease in a patient with the highest accuracy, F1 score and ROC-AUC metric.
3) To evaluate feature importance of a model and to analyze the most impactful factors. The dataset was taken from Kaggle repository: Heart Disease.
